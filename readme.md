</p>



Spec-Up is a technical specification development tool that enables you to create rich specification documents for standards bodies and engineering projects by writing in an extended version of markdown that features all the bells and whistles - for example: advanced syntax highlighting, notice blocks, complex tables, charts, UML diagrams, and more.

Using Spec-Up is easy peasy lemon squeezy:

1. `npm install spec-up`
2. Create a subdirectory in your project with two files:
    - `spec.json` - add some basic config values, like your desired HTML page title, etc.
    - `spec.md` - write the markdown version of your spec here (duh)
3. In your main node.js file, drop in this bad boy: `require('spec-up')()`

Boom! That's it. Spec-Up will auto-detect the location of your spec files and auto-generate your spec's HTML version every time you hit save after editing your `spec.md` files. Did I mention you can have multiple specs located at any depth in your project and Spec-Up will crawl up in there and render all those specs like a damn boss? Well it does, because why the hell not.
